# My DSA & Coding Practice Repository

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  

This is my personal repository where I keep all my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice and solutions from sites like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks (GFG). I use it to track my progress, practice problem-solving, and get better at coding interviews.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- DSA â€“ My solutions organized by topic like Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Recursion, Graphs, and more.  
- Leet-Code â€“ Problems I solved on LeetCode.  
- GFG â€“ Problems I solved on GeeksforGeeks.  

Basically, everything Iâ€™ve been practicing lives here.

## Why I Made This

I wanted a single place to:

1. Keep all my DSA solutions organized.  
2. Track my progress in solving problems.  
3. Learn by writing clean and understandable code.  
4. Prepare for coding interviews and real-world challenges.
